Overview:
Wavelet compression is a popular method for image compression, which leverages wavelet transforms to represent an image in a more efficient way, typically achieving high compression ratios with minimal loss of quality. The general idea is to decompose the image into a set of wavelet coefficients that can be quantized and encoded more effectively than the original pixel values.
