# Wavelet Compression of Imagery
Final Project from CU Boulder's Data Structures 2270, under Applied Computer Science Bachelors Program.


## Overview:
Wavelet compression is a popular method for image compression, which leverages wavelet transforms to represent an image in a more efficient way, typically achieving high compression ratios with minimal loss of quality. The general idea is to decompose the image into a set of wavelet coefficients that can be quantized and encoded more effectively than the original pixel values.

## Details:
- Project data structure implemented:
- Short explanation of the data structure:
- If your project is something I can run, please give instructions on how to do that
- If your project isn't something that I can run, show me what it does. You can take a video and upload it to YouTube or Vimeo or simply to a private Google drive link. Or if video isn't your thing, a document with screenshots and words explaining what's going on:
