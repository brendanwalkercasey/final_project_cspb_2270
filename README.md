# Wavelet Compression of Imagery
Final Project from CU Boulder's Data Structures 2270, under Applied Computer Science Bachelors Program.


## Overview:
Wavelet compression is a popular method for image compression, which leverages wavelet transforms to represent an image in a more efficient way, typically achieving high compression ratios with minimal loss of quality. The general idea is to decompose the image into a set of wavelet coefficients that can be quantized and encoded more effectively than the original pixel values.  The wavelet transform is a mathematical tool that decomposes an image into different frequency components at multiple scales. These components capture both the low-frequency information (which contains the smooth, overall features of the image) and high-frequency details (which capture sharp edges and fine textures).

In simple terms, it’s akin to applying a filter to the image at different scales, allowing you to see both coarse and fine details in the image. By representing the image in terms of wavelet coefficients, we can selectively retain the most significant information while discarding less important data.
