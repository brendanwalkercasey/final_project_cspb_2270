Steps Taken/Abandoned:
	Opencv 
		required several dependencies:

			Package managers:

				- Homebrew package manager (decided not to use - see https://saagarjha.com/blog/2019/04/26/thoughts-on-macos-package-managers/)
				- Macports package manager (decided not to use - see above, requires a lot of manual configurations I think?)

			General Dependencies from downloading from source:

				- pkg-config 
					- when i ran pkg-config --modversion opencv4, my terminal returned zsh: command not found: pkg-config
				- pkg-config required glib which depending on the version downloaded, could not run ./confgure, and instead required meson

			Issues downloading from pre-compiled binaries:
				- opencv pre-compiled binaries wouldn't link to my test_opencv.cpp code (test code for reading an image)
	Compilation Errors:

		#define M_PI 3.14159265358979323846 commented out because it caught its orginal definition when compiling (so this is uneccessary)
		
Steps Taken/Pursued:

	Grayscale transform: 
		(Brendan note: Do I need grayscale transform??? i.e. does this make encoding easier instead of rgba/argb channels?  Or will I need to decode back to rgba/argb?)
	LibTIFF:
		Used primarily to read/write TIFF (to/from temp buffer)and make necessary conversions with built in functions
		Settled on Libtiff library because I can convert to grayscale measurements using bit shifting with the luminance method (i.e. 0.299 * R + 0.587 * G + 0.114 * B)
	Wavelet Transform:
		Haar as a default, but would like to impliment something more complex (Haar, Daubechies, Coiflets, Symlets, etc.)
		Mexican Hat (worked)
    	Daubechies == too computationally complex (run-time etc.)?
Syntax changes:

	used #define to re-assign std::uint32_t types to "u32" (reduce space)


Issues (Ongoing):
	Output:
		test_libtiff_v03 runs successfully...but I cant seem to open output tiff.
	Decode:
		Do I need this to see output tiff? Do I need to input the encoded output tiff?



******** To-Do *************

- new tiff (grayscale)
- add inverse transform to v02 (save as new version)
